Introduce equality and its associated rules of inference.

statement = (a b)

display ¬ = a b as (a ≠ b in parens)

axiom Equality Is Reflexive
conclusion = a a

axiom Substitution of Equals
premise = a b elidable
premise with (a) φ elidable
conclusion with (b) φ

comment We first have to prove that equality is symmetric before we can prove the reversed version of the second axiom.

theorem Reverse Equality
premise = a b
conclusion = b a

comment Now we can also prove that the substitution axiom works when substituting into equal terms.

theorem Substitution of Equals
premise = a b elidable
conclusion = with (a) F with (b) F
