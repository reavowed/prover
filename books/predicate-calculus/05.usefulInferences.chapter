Some inferences that can be used to reduce boilerplate in proofs.

theorem Redundant And in Existential Quantifier
premise ∃ a with ($0) φ
assume ∃ x ∧ with ($0) φ ψ {
  let a ∧ with ($0) φ ψ {
    prove ψ
  }
}
assume ψ {
  let a with ($0) φ {
    prove ∧ with ($0) φ ψ
    prove ∃ x ∧ with ($$0) φ ψ
  }
}
prove ↔ ∃ x ∧ with ($0) φ ψ ψ
