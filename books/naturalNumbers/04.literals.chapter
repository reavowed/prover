chapter Natural Number Literals
Define some literal natural numbers - 0, 1, 2, etc.

term 0 () (= _ ∅)

theorem 0 Is a Natural Number
prove = 0 ∅
assume inductive X {
  prove ∈ ∅ X
  prove ∈ 0 X
}
prove → inductive X ∈ 0 X
prove ∀ X → inductive X ∈ 0 X
prove ∈ 0 ℕ

term 1 () (= _ successor 0)

theorem 1 Is a Natural Number
prove ∈ 0 ℕ
prove ∈ successor 0 ℕ
prove = 1 successor 0
