Define the power set of a set - the set of all its subsets.

axiom Axiom of Power Set
termVariables(a 0)
conclusion ∃ x ∀ y ↔ ∈ $0 $$0 ⊆ $0 t0

theorem Power Sets Are Unique
termVariables(a 0)
conclusion ∃! x ∀ y ↔ ∈ $0 $$0 ⊆ $0 t0

term powerSet (a)
  name (Power Set)
  format (𝒫a)
  (∀ x ↔ ∈ $0 $$0 ⊆ $0 t0)
  shorthand (power)

theorem Subset Is in Power Set
termVariables(b 0, a 0)
premise ⊆ t0 t1
conclusion ∈ t0 powerSet t1

theorem Element of Power Set Is Subset
termVariables(b 0, a 0)
premise ∈ t0 powerSet t1
conclusion ⊆ t0 t1

theorem ∅ Is in Any Power Set
termVariables(a 0)
conclusion ∈ ∅ powerSet t0

theorem Any Set Is in Its Own Power Set
termVariables(a 0)
conclusion ∈ t0 powerSet t0
