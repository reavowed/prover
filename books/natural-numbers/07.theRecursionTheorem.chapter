Prove the recursion theorem for recursively constructing functions on ℕ.

theorem An Inductive Function Is Unique
premise ∃ f ∧ function $0 ℕ A ∧ = apply $0 0 a_0 ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 successor $0 with ($0) a
let f' ∧ function $0 ℕ A ∧ = apply $0 0 a_0 ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 successor $0 with ($0) a {
  take f {
    assume ∧ function $0 ℕ A ∧ = apply $0 0 a_0 ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 successor $0 with ($0) a {
      prove = apply $0 0 apply $$0 0
      take n {
        assume ∧ ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 $0 apply $$$0 $0 {
          prove = apply $$0 successor $0 with ($0) a
          prove = apply $$$0 successor $0 with ($0) a
          prove = apply $$0 successor $0 apply $$$0 successor $0
        }
      }
      prove ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 $0 apply $$$0 $0
      prove = $0 $$0
    }
  }
  prove ∃! f ∧ function $0 ℕ A ∧ = apply $0 0 a_0 ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 successor $0 with ($0) a
