Prove the recursion theorem for recursively constructing functions on ℕ.

theorem An Inductive Function Is Unique
termVariables(A 0, a_0 0, a 1)
premise ∃ f ∧ ∧ function $0 functionFrom $0 ℕ t0 ∧ = apply $0 0ℕ t1 ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 successor $0 with (apply $$0 $0) t2
conclusion ∃! f ∧ ∧ function $0 functionFrom $0 ℕ t0 ∧ = apply $0 0ℕ t1 ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 successor $0 with (apply $$0 $0) t2

theorem 𝒫(ℕ × X) Contains All Functions from a Natural Number to X
termVariables(n 0, f 0, A 0)
premise ∈ t0 ℕ
premise ∧ function t1 functionFrom t1 t0 t2
conclusion ∈ t1 powerSet product ℕ t2

theorem Extend Function from a Natural Number to Its Successor
termVariables(n 0, f 0, A 0, a 0, g 0)
premise ∈ t0 ℕ
premise ∧ function t1 functionFrom t1 t0 t2
premise ∈ t3 t2
premise = t4 ∪ t1 singleton orderedPair t0 t3
conclusion ∧ function t4 functionFrom t4 successor t0 t2

theorem Recursion Theorem
termVariables(f 0, X 0, g_0 0)
premise ∧ function t0 functionFrom t0 t1 t1
premise ∈ t2 t1
conclusion ∃! g ∧ ∧ function $0 functionFrom $0 ℕ t1 ∧ = apply $0 0ℕ t2 ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 successor $0 apply t0 apply $$0 $0

theorem Uncurry Recursive Function
termVariables(A 0, F_0 1, F_+ 2)
premise ∀ n → ∈ $0 ℕ ∃! f ∧ ∧ function $0 functionFrom $0 ℕ t0 ∧ = apply $0 0ℕ with ($$0) t1 ∀ m → ∈ $0 ℕ = apply $$0 successor $0 with ($$$0 apply $$0 $0) t2
