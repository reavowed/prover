Having established the basic properties of all our connectives, we can now prove a list of identities relating them.

theorem And Is Symmetric
statementVariables(φ 0, ψ 0)
conclusion ↔ ∧ s0 s1 ∧ s1 s0

theorem Or Is Symmetric
statementVariables(φ 0, ψ 0)
conclusion ↔ ∨ s0 s1 ∨ s1 s0

theorem And Is Idempotent
statementVariables(φ 0)
conclusion ↔ ∧ s0 s0 s0

theorem Or Is Idempotent
statementVariables(φ 0)
conclusion ↔ ∨ s0 s0 s0
